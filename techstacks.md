# Getting the most out of vibe coding
When using an AI model to help you coding your projects, it pays to give thought to and be clear about your requirements up front. Giving the model some constraints via a well-trodden framework will increase your chances of success

So in essence try to be a more of a "vibe engineer" than a "vibe coder". You will get less grey hairs that way.

# Popular tech stacks
If you're not sure what frameworks might apply, have a conversation with AI to find ones that might work for you before you start coding. Here are some examples to get you started.

## Web development
### Modern React stack
A very modern and popular tech stack used in web dev at the moment is a React stack, sometimes called a Next.js stack. This is aligned with JAMstack principles (JavaScript, APIs, Markup).

The flavour I'm using for my projects includes the following:

- **React** – UI library
- **Next.js** – React framework with routing, SSR (server-side rendering), SSG (static site generation)
- **TypeScript** – Adds types to JavaScript (helps with catching errors early, code maintainability, and scalability)
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework (modular CSS with less customisation)
