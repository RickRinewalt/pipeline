## YOLO-PRO Workflow Integration

### Work Chunking Protocol (WCP)
- **Epic Size**: [Small/Medium/Large] - Target: 2-4 weeks total
- **Feature Count**: [2-7] features (max 3 issues per feature)
- **Delivery Strategy**: Sequential feature delivery with CI validation

### CI/CD Protocol
```
âœ… Per CLAUDE.md enhanced patterns:
- Pre-flight validation enabled
- Agent coordination active  
- Context management configured
- GitHub integration enabled
- Version compatibility verified
```

### Agent Assignment Strategy
- **Epic Coordinator**: [Agent type] - Overall coordination and tracking
- **Feature Agents**: [Agent types] - Assigned per feature complexity
- **Review Agents**: [Agent types] - Quality assurance and validation

### Enhanced Command Pattern
```bash
# Research phase
yolo-research "[Epic scope and objectives]"

# Analysis phase  
yolo-analyze "#[this-epic-number]" "feasibility, technical complexity, resource requirements"

# Specification phase
yolo-spec "#[this-epic-number]"

# Development phase (per feature)
yolo-dev
```

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk Items
- [ ] Risk 1 - [Description, Impact: High/Medium/Low, Mitigation strategy]
- [ ] Risk 2 - [Description, Impact: High/Medium/Low, Mitigation strategy]

### Medium Risk Items  
- [ ] Risk 3 - [Description, Impact: High/Medium/Low, Mitigation strategy]

### Mitigation Strategies
- Risk monitoring checkpoints at each feature completion
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- Alternative approaches identified for critical path items
