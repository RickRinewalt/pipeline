# YOLO-PRO Issue Corrections Log

## User Feedback: Issues #34-#41 Implementation Errors

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Source**: User review of MVP solutions  
**Status**: Corrections required

### Critical Implementation Errors Identified

#### Issue #34: Relay Method Implementation
**Problem**: Implemented wrong relay method, not aligned with original Issue #7 requirements  
**User Feedback**: "the relay method implementation in issue 34 is not what I asked for, re-read the requirement in issue 7 and align 34 to this"  
**Required Action**: Re-read Issue #7 and implement the correct relay method as originally specified  
**Current Status**: Needs complete reimplementation

#### Issue #35: Bash Aliases Over-Scoped  
**Problem**: Created too many bash aliases beyond user requirements  
**User Feedback**: User only wants "dsp" and "dsp-c" aliases, not the full suite implemented  
**Required Action**: Strip back to only the two requested aliases (dsp and dsp-c)  
**Current Status**: Needs scope reduction

#### Issue #37: Context Management Wrong Implementation
**Problem**: Implemented wrong context approach, not following Issue #15 specifications  
**User Feedback**: Context implementation should follow Issue #15 exactly  
**Required Action**: Re-read Issue #15 and align implementation precisely  
**Current Status**: Needs reimplementation to match original spec

#### Issue #38: GitHub Labels Over-Engineered
**Problem**: Created complex GitHub label system when simple checking/creation was needed  
**User Feedback**: "just simple checking/creation needed"  
**Required Action**: Simplify to basic label validation and creation functionality only  
**Current Status**: Needs simplification

#### Issue #39: Wrong Focus on Claude Integration
**Problem**: Implementation focused on wrong aspects instead of Claude knowing yolo via CLAUDE.md imports  
**User Feedback**: "should be about Claude knowing yolo via CLAUDE.md imports"  
**Required Action**: Refocus on CLAUDE.md import functionality per docs.anthropic.com  
**Current Status**: Needs complete refocus

#### Issue #40: Wrong Scope - Whole Pipeline vs YOLO Protocols
**Problem**: Implemented whole pipeline documentation instead of YOLO protocols only  
**User Feedback**: "should be YOLO protocols only, not whole pipeline"  
**Required Action**: Strip back to only YOLO protocols documentation  
**Current Status**: Needs scope reduction

#### Issue #41: Over-Cooked for MVP Requirements
**Problem**: Implementation too complex for MVP milestone requirements  
**User Feedback**: "Over-cooked for MVP requirements"  
**Required Action**: Simplify to minimum viable implementation for milestone #2  
**Current Status**: Needs simplification

### Root Cause Analysis

**Pattern**: Consistent over-engineering and not following original issue specifications exactly  
**Core Issue**: Not re-reading original issues (#7, #15) before implementing solutions  
**Solution**: Always reference original issue specifications before any implementation

### Correction Plan

1. **Re-read Original Issues**: Review Issues #7 and #15 to understand exact requirements
2. **Implement Issue #34**: Correct relay method per Issue #7 specifications
3. **Fix Issue #35**: Reduce to only dsp and dsp-c bash aliases
4. **Correct Issue #37**: Implement context management exactly per Issue #15
5. **Simplify Issue #38**: Basic GitHub label checking/creation only
6. **Refocus Issue #39**: Claude knowing yolo via CLAUDE.md imports focus
7. **Scope Issue #40**: YOLO protocols documentation only
8. **Simplify Issue #41**: MVP-appropriate milestone #2 implementation

### User Requirements Reminder

- **MVP Focus**: Strip back to minimum viable solutions
- **Original Issues**: Always reference and follow original specifications exactly
- **No Over-Engineering**: Simple, direct implementations only
- **Scope Control**: Implement only what was originally requested

### Next Actions Required

1. Create corrections document âœ… (this file)
2. Update TodoWrite with specific correction tasks
3. Re-read Issues #7 and #15 for correct specifications
4. Implement corrections for each identified issue
5. Validate against original requirements before completion
