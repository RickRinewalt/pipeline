# GitHub Issues Update Required

## User Feedback: Issues Need to be Updated on GitHub

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Status**: CRITICAL - GitHub issues do not reflect corrections made to local files

### Issues Requiring Updates on GitHub:

#### Issue #34 - Relay Method Implementation 
**Problem**: Current GitHub issue does not match Issue #7 requirements
**User Feedback**: "the relay method implementation in issue 34 is not what I asked for, re-read the requirement in issue 7 and align 34 to this. Ensure issue 34 is steering us to use the latest available package where possible."
**Action Required**: 
- Re-read Issue #7 specification exactly
- Update Issue #34 on GitHub to match Issue #7 requirements
- Ensure focus on using latest available packages

#### Issue #35 - Bash Aliases Over-Scoped
**Problem**: GitHub issue still shows full alias system
**User Feedback**: "per issue 10, i only want bash aliases for dsp and dsp-c, so update issue 35 accordingly"
**Action Required**:
- Update Issue #35 on GitHub to scope down to only dsp and dsp-c aliases
- Remove all other alias requirements from GitHub issue

#### Issue #37 - Context Implementation Wrong
**Problem**: GitHub issue doesn't match Issue #15 specification
**User Feedback**: "the implementation for 37 is quite clearly described in issue 15, you clearly didn't get the brief so fix 37"
**Action Required**:
- Re-read Issue #15 specification exactly
- Update Issue #37 on GitHub to match Issue #15 requirements exactly

#### Issue #38 - GitHub Labels Over-Engineered
**Problem**: GitHub issue is too complex
**User Feedback**: "I think you have over-cooked 38, I just want a simple way to ensure you check which labels are available before you create github issues so you a) don't create duplicate labels and b) create any require labels before creating issues"
**Action Required**:
- Update Issue #38 on GitHub to simple scope: check available labels, avoid duplicates, create required labels before issue creation

#### Issue #39 - Wrong Focus on Claude Integration
**Problem**: GitHub issue focuses on wrong aspects
**User Feedback**: "issue 39 is wrong, this one is actually about ensuring claude to know about yolo, so ensure we follow https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#claude-md-imports and as part of the yolo-pro init process, append claude.md with file reference to yolo-pro usage guide"
**Action Required**:
- Update Issue #39 on GitHub to focus on Claude knowing about yolo
- Follow docs.anthropic.com/claude-code/memory#claude-md-imports
- Specify appending claude.md with file reference during yolo-pro init

#### Issue #40 - Documentation Scope Too Broad
**Problem**: GitHub issue covers whole pipeline project
**User Feedback**: "issue 40 scope should only be about the updates to YOLO protocols and not the whole pipeline project"
**Action Required**:
- Update Issue #40 on GitHub to focus only on YOLO protocols updates
- Remove whole pipeline project documentation scope

#### Issue #41 - Over-Cooked for MVP
**Problem**: GitHub issue too complex for MVP milestone
**User Feedback**: "issue 41 looks overcooked based on our MVP requirements (all issues in milestone #2)"
**Action Required**:
- Update Issue #41 on GitHub to MVP-appropriate scope for milestone #2
- Strip down to essential directory structure requirements only

### Root Cause:
- Updated local implementation files but failed to update corresponding GitHub issues
- GitHub issues still reflect original over-engineered scope
- Need to align all GitHub issues with corrected specifications and user feedback

### Next Actions:
1. Update each GitHub issue individually with correct specifications
2. Ensure all issues reflect MVP scope appropriate for milestone #2
3. Validate each issue against original requirements (Issues #7, #10, #15)
4. Confirm all updates are live on GitHub before proceeding
