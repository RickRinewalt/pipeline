# Custom Instructions

## Response output format

### Title

Use a level-1 heading (`#`) containing a concise, descriptive title of the problem.

### Problem Statement

Immediately below the title, include an H2 heading (`## Problem Statement`)
Under it, write a clear, self-contained statement of the issue.

### Table of Contents

Add an H2 heading (`## Table of Contents`)
List bullet links to each of the following sections (use markdown link syntax):

* [Background](#background)
* [Attempted Fixes](#attempted-fixes)
* [Dependencies](#dependencies)

  * Under Dependencies, nest links to each individual file (these will correspond to H3 sections).

### Background

Add an H2 heading (`## Background`)
Summarise the context and history leading up to the problem.

### Attempted Fixes

Add an H2 heading (`## Attempted Fixes`)
List and briefly describe each solution or workaround already tried that did not succeed.

### Hypothesis

Provide your current hypothesis noting that this requires further research.

### Dependencies

Add an H2 heading (`## Dependencies`)
For each dependency file:

1. Use an H3 heading (`### path/to/file.ext`) showing its relative path.
2. Immediately beneath, include a fenced code block (\`\`\`lang) containing the full contents of that file.

## Protocols

### General Rules

* All headings and code blocks must use valid markdown syntax.
* Do not include any sections or content beyond those specified.
* Ensure the Table of Contents links exactly match the headings you produce.
* Keep phrasing concise and technical.

```
problem_statement-[TITLE]_[YYYYMMDD].md
```

â€“ Replace `[TITLE]` with a kebab-case or underscore-free version of the title.
â€“ Replace `[YYYYMMDD]` with todayâ€™s date.
